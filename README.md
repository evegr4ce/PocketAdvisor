## 🚀 Overview

**Pocket Advisor** is a financial wellness web app that goes beyond budgeting.  
It analyzes how much you actually use your subscriptions, determines what you can realistically afford, and gives you clear, personalized advice.

Instead of asking: *“What do you want to buy?”*  
We answer: **“What is safe for you to spend?”**

---

## ✨ What Makes It Different

Most finance apps show charts.  
**Pocket Advisor tells you what to do.**

- Not just tracking → **decision intelligence**  
- Not generic budgets → **income-aware affordability**  
- Not just subscriptions → **usage-based value scoring**  
- Not just dashboards → **AI-powered personal advice**

---

## 🧠 Core Features

### 📊 Financial Wellness Score
A real-time score based on:
- Income
- Essential expenses
- Discretionary spending

You also get **action steps** to improve your financial health.

---

### 🔁 Subscription Usage Intelligence (Cost-Per-Use)
We don’t just list subscriptions—we analyze value.

For each subscription:
- Track **how much you used it this month**
- Calculate **cost per use**
- Label it:
  - **Keep** → high value  
  - **Remove** → low usage, high cost  
  - **Better alternative** → your usage fits a cheaper plan

**Example Insight:**  
> *“Canceling this subscription funds 3 weeks of groceries or $500 toward emergency savings in 4 months.”*

---

### ⚡ Smart Optimize
- Detects low-usage, high-cost subscriptions
- One-click **Optimize** recommends what to cut for the biggest financial impact

---

### 🏠 Affordability Engine
Tells you what you can actually afford—before you make a costly mistake.

Supports:

- Long-term security over short-term comfort  

The result: fewer financial mistakes, less stress, and real control over what’s in your pocket.
